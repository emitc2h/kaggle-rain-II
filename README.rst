| **project:** Kaggle competition : How much does it rain? II - https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-much-did-it-rain-ii (finished 12.07.2015)
| **author:** Michel Trottier-McDonald <michel.trottiermcdonald@gmail.com>
| **summary:** Predict amount of rain on the ground using weather radar data. I picked this challenge as an occasion to learn pandas. The data has lots of missing values and outliers to deal with, which makes this challenge particularly interesting.
| **strategy:** I used boosted regression trees after dividing the data into 5 categories.
| **final ranking:** 325/587
| **jupyter notebook with final solution:** https://github.com/emitc2h/kaggle-rain-II/blob/46a7ca0db0f6465340f5e72d3efa9ac06e94e5d8/final_solution.ipynb
